23 years young, doing an education in Germany as a Computer Science Expert Subject Area: Software Development.<br/>
My coding experience has started with Python, Django and Web Development.

Switched to Java because of my education and wrote some own programs with it. <br/>
So most of my knowledge is in Java now.

On the other side i worked with docker and virtual machines. <br/>
I worked with Centos 7 as a VM where i managed to run wordpress, phpmyadmin, openpvn and other things. <br/>
On Docker i did run wordpress too.


I like to create own programs, leetcode or simply help other people with my tech knowledge.
